## Running The Project

To run our project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are running Python version `3.13.5`.
2. Install dependencies located in `pyproject.toml`.
3. Our project has only been tested on Windows and Google Colab systems. Final testing was completed only on Google Colab using an A100 GPU runtime. Support is not garaunteed for other systems, but it should still run as long as you meet all dependencies.
4. Run `main.py.`
5. Final plotted results are saved to the `results` directory (will be created if necessary).
